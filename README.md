# Python Fundamentals Mini-Projects

This repository contains the Python mini-projects I’m building as I refresh and strengthen my core programming skills. These projects follow my 10-week AI Automation Career Roadmap and focus on solid fundamentals before moving into APIs, LLMs, and full AI apps.

## ✅ Concepts Practiced So Far

- Running Python scripts from VS Code and the terminal
- `print()`, variables, and basic arithmetic
- User input and `int()` casting
- Control flow: `if / elif / else`, `while` loops
- Working with Python data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- Using the `random` module for simple game logic
- Git and GitHub basics (init, add, commit, push)

## 📁 Mini-Projects Included

- **hello.py** – First Python script
- **mini_calculator.py** – Interactive calculator using user input and arithmetic
- **number_guessing_game.py** – Replayable number guessing game with loops, conditionals, and randomness
- **todo_cli_app.py** – A simple command-line To-Do List app with add/view/remove/clear functionality

More Python fundamentals mini-projects will be added here as I progress through the roadmap. While I already had experience using Python before this, I chose to start from scratch so I can properly document my progress for the record.
