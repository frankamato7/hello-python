# Day 1 Mini Projects

This repository contains the Python practice projects I completed on Day 1 of my AI Automation Career Roadmap. These exercises cover essential beginner skills, including:

### ✅ Concepts Practiced
- User input
- Variables
- Basic math operations
- Printing
- Running Python scripts
- Git & GitHub basics

### 📁 Projects Included
- **hello.py** – First Python script
- **mini_calculator.py** – A simple interactive calculator program

While I already had lots of experience using Python before this date, I thought I'd start from scratch again so that I can properly document my progress for the record
